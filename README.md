Especially for Louis, who can't seem to control himself when he gets the urge to move at the wrong time and situation.

My knees start itching.My toes start twitching.My skin gets jumpy.Others get grumpy.

Louis' mom comes to the rescue by teaching him techniques to help keep his inner itching, twitching and jumping to be a verb in check.

Review: I cried reading this book. My 7yo son has been struggling with ADHD, and like many parents, I tried everything. Oils, vitamins, diet changes, act. I have never been someone who likes giving medicine to my children, but after reading this book, I finally took him in to see a specialist. He was given medication, and doubled his reading and math scores in the first 2 weeks. They no longer want to put him in special ed, or hold him back.I will admit that it wasn't just about not wanting to put him on meds. It was the stigma of parents that do. "Oh it's so easy to just drug your kids" or "It's lazy parenting." - but after reading this book, and the look on my son's face when he identified with it, I finally got him the help he needed.Thank you! This book was such a blessing. I now understand how he feels, and can be a better parent. <3

Title: Disappointing
Date: Reviewed in the United States on April 21, 2021
Review: Having a husband, child, and now a grandchild that are verbs, I was excited to find a book with kids like them. We snuggled in to read it over FaceTime with my granddaughter as she twitched, fidgeted, and rolled around on her floor next to her phone. We all recognized the feelings and the grumpy reactions of adults that don‚Äôt understand, the mom gave some excellent coping strategies and the book was going so well.Then, it took a hard left for me.One - strategies like the ones the mom gave take hard work and don‚Äôt work at all for many children.Two - couching a tool to help a child with negative terms like ‚Äònag board‚Äô paint that negative behavior is being corrected instead of just finding the tool that works best for their success.Three - ‚Äòbehaving‚Äô as people perceive you ‚Äòshould‚Äô behave gets a star?? Just because kids with ADHD are wiggling doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt listening. Some of the most intellectual observations I‚Äôve ever experienced in my classroom came from students who looked as if they weren‚Äôt absorbing a thing being said. And my wiggly granddaughter, could recite the repeated lines before they were read to her-even as she wiggled through the story.I was very disappointed in this book.

Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 10, 2018
Review: This is a cute book, and the idea is great, however, I probably would not have purchased this one if I had read it prior. The thing I disliked the most, is how mom tells Louis that she ‚Äúhas had it with him‚Äù and that she called the list she wrote a ‚Äúnag board‚Äù. The thing I liked was how she gave him the ‚Äútools‚Äù to help him succeed. I would have rather seen this written as a little more positive approach.

Title: AperfectlessonthatsgoodforallearlyElementarykids
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 8, 2016
Review: Purchased for reading with my Autistic son (6yrs old and in Kindergarten). I LOVE the storyline and it keeps the interest of my son while delivering an important message! I shared this book with his Kindergarten teacher and she has asked to keep it in the classroom to read/share with ALL 25 kids! It respectfully explains how ASD or ADD/ADHD kids feel throughout the day while also showing that responsibility for personal actions is important for EVERYONE! I hope others benefit from this story just as our family has... as a RN and mother I HIGHLY suggest you purchase or seek out these books at your local library for your children. You won't be disappointed :)

Review: Julia Cook has quickly become one of my favorite authors. I am a teacher and I believe she has the most perfect books to help with classroom management. I hope to continue to build my collection of her books to use throughout the school year. They are a meaningful, fun, engaging way to help communicate a message to young children. This particular book tells the story of a "busy body," and shares strategies that very active children sometimes need to use to be successful. It's a great way to reiterate that every student is an individual and has their own needs!

Title: BESTbook
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2011
Review: This is undoubtedly the best book I have read to my son about his behavior. He actually asked if the book was about him. My son is 5 and has been diagnosed with ADD/ADHD. We are not currently medicating, but are working on some behavior modifications. I don't think this book is exclusively for ADD/ADHD children, however, most children have problems sitting still & focusing! I love that this book is not only relate-able for children, but also give very clear ideas and solutions to the behavior. It IS hard to be a busy 5 year old with ADD, however, there are ways to work with it. The ideas are life skills that my son can use for the rest of his life. It is harder to get through life with ADD, I have it too and know first hand how difficult staying on task in school and in work can be. However, adopting the skills necessary at a very young age is so important.Another reviewer commented how the dad in the book thinks that some of the methods are "strange". I also like that part of the book. It demonstrates that while some people may think the methods are odd, they can still help!

Review: This has some valid suggestions on how assist children with impulse control issue. However, sometimes ADHD can become a huge factor and children need more than fidgets and to do boards to help; such as medicine. It‚Äôs still a good book with good recommendations for those he cannot take medicine.

Review: This book is a wonderful addition to any classroom, but I used it in my Special Education classroom. It has a great lesson and students can resonate with the main character. I think it is also a good reminder to parents and teachers. Good read all around!
